# K-Means Clustering on Air Pollution Dataset

## Title & Summary
**K-Means Clustering of Air Pollution Data**  
This project utilizes the "airpoll" dataset to apply K-means clustering, aiming to identify patterns and groupings in air pollution data.

## Problem Statement
The project addresses the challenge of analyzing air pollution data to uncover underlying patterns and group similar observations, facilitating better understanding and management of air quality issues.

## Methods Used
- **K-Means Clustering**: A popular unsupervised learning algorithm for partitioning data into distinct groups.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: For dimensionality reduction to visualize clusters.
- **StandardScaler**: For normalizing the dataset before clustering.

## Key Visuals
- **Correlation Matrix Heatmap**: Displays the correlation between different pollutants.
- **Histograms**: Illustrate the distribution of each pollutant.
- **Elbow Method Plot**: Helps determine the ideal number of clusters.
- **Silhouette Score Plot**: Evaluates the quality of clustering.
- **PCA Scatter Plot**: Visualizes the clustered data in two dimensions.

## Outcome/Insight
The project successfully identified optimal clusters within the air pollution data, providing insights into the relationships and distributions of pollutants that can aid in environmental monitoring and policy-making.
